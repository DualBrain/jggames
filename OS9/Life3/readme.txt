The two files contained in this archive represent the source
code for a version of Tom Conway's life simulation.  These
files are:

life3.c     C version of the program
life3.b09   Basic09 version


I have also included the executable of the C version of the
program.

life3

To run the program in various display sizes you must know the
size of the window you are in.  When prompted report the width
of the window and the height, minus 1 line.  The last line of
the screen is needed for the program to report the generation
of the life display.  The program should work with the normal
32 X 16 screen of OS9 level 1.  Just enter 32 and 15 for the
screen size.
