PieThis is a Basic program fordrawing pie charts on thehires screen of a CoCo 1 and 2.  It must be run froma VDG screen and is thuscompatible with OS9 level 1Version 2. Make sure theVersion 2 GRFO module is inmemory.After you input the valuesfor the pieces and endthe list with 9999 the graphis drawn on the hires screen.After the chart is displayedyou can save it to disk byhitting the space bar. It is saved into the workingdirectory as the filePIECHART.PIC, which can thenbe loaded into a graphicsprogram like Illustrator orDeskmate for annotation andshading.I have included both thesource (pie.b09) and therunb executable file (pie).I have also included a utility from the rainbowcalled gsave which mustalso be in you CMDSdirectory.  Make sure theattributes are setcorrectly (ATTR e pe)on the files pie andgsort.Enjoy.Jim GerrieFebruary 2002jgerrie@becon.orgLong Live Retro-Computing!
