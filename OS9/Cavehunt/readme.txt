                          Jim Gerrie's OS9 Lv 1 Progs

Cave and Cavehunt are my attempts at an OS9 conversion of an RS-DOS program,
published in a magazine (Rainbow, Hot Coco?) in the 1980s.
 
I hope I am not breaking any copyright laws by distributing it on the web.

The program was written in BASIC09 and must be run from a 32 X 16 VDG screen.
Also one must have the GFX module in loaded memory and probably the INKEY
function.
