                               BOMB'S AWAY OS9This is my attempt at an OS9 conversion of a RS-DOS program published in theRAINBOW a few years back.  This game program was a game in which two playersfire shells back and forth at each other over a mountain by entering velocity and degrees. I hope I am not breaking any copyright laws bydistributing it on the web.The program was written in BASIC09 and must be run from a VDG screen.  Also one must have the GFX module in loaded memory.I have also included an icon and AIF file to run the program from multivue.The AIF file runs a script file that sets up a VDG window.--- Jim G.  1998.
